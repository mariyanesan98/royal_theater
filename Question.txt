Q : If you are a software engineer in a software company, how do you communicate with your team members?

A : 
Good communication does not mean more communication. In many cases, quality over quantity is the key. 
We all have a variety of communication channels to manage these days and the clearer you can be with less words will often be appreciated by the recipient. 
You should aim to say fewer things, but without losing the impactful point of the message.

Listen carefully to what the other person is saying. Do not interrupt. Then, prior to adding your own comment to their thoughts, 
a great technique is to rephrase what you heard with your own words to confirm that you are fully understanding what the other person is attempting to communicate.
